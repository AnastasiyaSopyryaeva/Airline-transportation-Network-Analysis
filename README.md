# Airline-transportation-Network-Analysis

The purpose of the project is to conduct network study in the field of spatial networks. In particular, I conducted a comparative study of airline passenger transportation networks of Russia (inside/to/from the country) in two different time spans: before and after international sanctions of 2014-2022. The main idea is to discover differences that occurred after the sanctions have been applied.
The study is conducted as as an end-of-course project for the "Network Analysis" course of the Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge of the University of Bologna, held by professor Giallorenzo Saverio.
